The paw lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.<br>The paw is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The paw doesn't fill its space.<br>When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the paw up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.<br>&bull;<b>Clenched Fist:</b> The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.<br>&bull;<b>Forceful Paw:</b> The paw attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the paw's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the paw pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The paw moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.<br>&bull;<b>Grasping Paw:</b> The paw attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the paw's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the paw is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the paw crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.<br>&bull;<b>Interposing Paw:</b> The paw interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The paw moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the paw's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the paw's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the paw's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the paw's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.<br>&bull;<b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.<br>","edited":true},{"name":"Teleportation Circle","level":5,"castTime":"1 minute","range":"10 feet","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":false,"material":"rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes"},"classes":["Bard","Sorcerer","Wizard"],"school":"Conjuration","duration":"1 round","selected":true,"casterClass":"Wizard","attackBonus":9,"saveDc":17},{"name":"Seeming","level":5,"castTime":"1 action","range":"30 feet","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false},"classes":["Bard","Sorcerer","Wizard"],"school":"Illusion","duration":"8 hours","casterClass":"Wizard","attackBonus":9,"saveDc":17},{"name":"Invisibility","level":2,"castTime":"1 action","range":"Touch","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":"an eyelash encased in gum arabic"},"classes":["Bard","Sorcerer","Warlock","Wizard","Artificer"],"school":"Illusion","duration":"Concentration up to 1 hour","casterClass":"Wizard","attackBonus":9,"saveDc":17},{"name":"Flaming Sphere","level":2,"castTime":"1 action","range":"60 feet","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":"a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron"},"classes":["Druid","Wizard"],"school":"Conjuration","duration":"Concentration up to 1 minute","casterClass":"Wizard","attackBonus":9,"saveDc":17},{"name":"Catapult","level":1,"castTime":"1 action","range":"60 feet","components":{"verbal":false,"somatic":true,"material":false},"classes":["Sorcerer","Wizard","Artificer (Revisited)","Artificer"],"school":"Transmutation","duration":"Instant","casterClass":"Wizard","attackBonus":9,"saveDc":17},{"name":"Gift of Alacrity","level":1,"castTime":"1 minute","range":"Touch","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false},"classes":["Wizard"],"school":"Dunamancy","duration":"8 hours","casterClass":"Wizard","attackBonus":9,"saveDc":17},{"name":"Fortune's Favor","level":2,"castTime":"1 minute","range":"Touch","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":"a white pearl worth at least 100gp"},"classes":["Wizard"],"school":"Dunamancy","duration":"1 hour","casterClass":"Wizard","attackBonus":9,"saveDc":17},{"name":"Fly","level":3,"castTime":"1 action","range":"Touch","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":"a wing feather from any bird"},"classes":["Sorcerer","Warlock","Wizard","Artificer"],"school":"Transmutation","duration":"Concentration up to 10 minutes","selected":true},{"name":"Widogast's Web of Fire","level":4,"castTime":"1 action","range":"60 feet","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":"A cat's cradle of thread coated in phosphorous"},"classes":["Wizard"],"school":"Evocation","duration":"Instant","selected":true}],"preparations":12}],"saves":{"str":0,"dex":0,"con":0,"wis":1,"int":1,"cha":0},"attributes":{"str":11,"dex":12,"con":14,"wis":16,"int":20,"cha":16},"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics","mult":0,"attribute":"dex"},{"name":"Animal Handling","mult":0,"attribute":"wis"},{"name":"Arcana","mult":1,"attribute":"int"},{"name":"Athletics","mult":0,"attribute":"str"},{"name":"Deception","mult":0,"attribute":"cha"},{"name":"History","mult":1,"attribute":"int"},{"name":"Insight","mult":1,"attribute":"wis"},{"name":"Intimidation","mult":0,"attribute":"cha"},{"name":"Investigation","mult":1,"attribute":"int"},{"name":"Medicine","mult":0,"attribute":"wis"},{"name":"Nature","mult":0,"attribute":"int"},{"name":"Perception","mult":0,"attribute":"wis"},{"name":"Performance","mult":0,"attribute":"cha"},{"name":"Persuasion","mult":0,"attribute":"cha"},{"name":"Religion","mult":0,"attribute":"int"},{"name":"Sleight of Hand","mult":0,"attribute":"dex"},{"name":"Stealth","mult":0,"attribute":"dex"},{"name":"Survival","mult":0,"attribute":"wis"}],"passives":[{"name":"Heart of Darkness","description":"Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness.
