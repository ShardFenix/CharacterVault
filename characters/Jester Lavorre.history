For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.<br>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.<br>When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.<br>&bull;<b>Explosive Runes:</b> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>&bull;<b>Spell Glyph:</b> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.<br>&bull;<b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.<br>"},{"name":"Greater Restoration","level":5,"castTime":"1 action","range":"Touch","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":"diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes"},"classes":["Bard","Cleric","Druid"],"school":"Abjuration","duration":"Instant","casterClass":"Cleric","attackBonus":2,"saveDc":10,"description":"You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect.

A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.<br>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.<br>"},{"name":"Control Weather","level":8,"castTime":"10 minutes","range":"Radius","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":"burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water"},"classes":["Cleric","Druid","Wizard"],"school":"Transmutation","duration":"Concentration up to 8 hours","casterClass":"Cleric","attackBonus":5,"saveDc":13,"description":"You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.

You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.<br>Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.<br>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.<br>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.

Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.<br>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it.

If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.<br>&bull;<b>Spells:</b> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.<br>&bull;<b>Magic Items:</b> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.

The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\n\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain featuresâsuch as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weaponsâthat are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\n\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\n\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\n\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.","categories":["Wondrous"],"count":1000,"tier":3,"value":30000,"proficiencies":[]}],"speed":30,"tempHp":0,"polyHp":0,"polyHpMax":0,"ac":"18","name":"Jester Lavorre"},null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]
